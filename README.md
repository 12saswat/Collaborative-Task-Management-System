I appreciate the opportunity to work on the Collaborative Task Management System assignment. Due to my ongoing commitments as an intern at Rojgaar.com, I was able to complete the backend and the registration/login pages using React. However, I couldn't complete the full frontend implementation within the given timeframe.

If partial submission is acceptable, I would be happy to submit my completed work for review. Otherwise, I understand if this affects my evaluation. Please let me know how you would like me to proceed.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
